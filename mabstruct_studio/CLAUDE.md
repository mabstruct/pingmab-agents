# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## The goal

**Build MABSTRUCT Studio: the application defined in [`REQUIREMENTS.md`](./REQUIREMENTS.md).**

**This is a learning project.** It exists to learn the multi-agent pipeline, not to operate a
game studio. Where a decision offers a simple option and a thorough one, take the simple one
and name the rough edge instead of engineering it away; deferring a requirement outright is a
legitimate answer. Several rough edges below are deliberate — don't file them as bugs.

That file is the authoritative spec for this project — read it before any design or
implementation work here. In short: keep the LangGraph pipeline that the notebook proved,
and wrap it in the three things the notebook cannot do —

- **persistence**, so ideas, designs, builds and deployments outlive the kernel (R1, R3, R6);
- **a human decision point**, so a person picks which idea proceeds to DESIGN and the run
  resumes from that choice days later (R2);
- **a feedback loop**, so deployed games can be rated, refurbished, ranked, and so lessons
  compound into later games (R4, R5, R7).

Nothing of the application exists yet. Today this directory holds two notebooks and their
output. Everything below *The reference implementation* describes that notebook — the thing
being ported *from*, not the target.

### Where application code goes

Settled in AD6/AD7 (ACCEPTED). Put new app code here, not in the notebook:

```
mabstruct_studio/
├── mabstruct_studio.ipynb          # spike environment — stays at root
├── mabstruct_experimenting.ipynb
├── dev-output/                     # gitignored notebook output
├── backend/
│   ├── pyproject.toml              # uv workspace member; package name `mabgames`
│   ├── src/mabgames/
│   │   ├── domain/                 # AD1 — schema, models, repository
│   │   ├── graph/                  # AD2 — phases ported from the notebook
│   │   ├── api/                    # AD3 — routes, run lifecycle
│   │   └── config.py
│   └── tests/
└── frontend/                       # AD4 — TS + Vite
```

- Imports read `from mabgames.domain import Idea` — the directory is `backend/`, the package
  is `mabgames`. Don't put the layer name in the package.
- **`domain/` is a sibling of `graph/`, never nested inside it.** AD1 turns on the domain
  schema outliving the pipeline; nesting would undo that.
- **Tests live with their runner.** pytest under `backend/tests/`, Vitest with the frontend.
  There is no top-level `tests/`; `e2e/` appears only when a real cross-stack test exists.
- **Backend dependencies:** `uv add <pkg>` from `backend/`. The parent repo stays the place
  to add anything the *notebooks* need. One shared `.venv` at the repo root still serves both.

### Working rules

- `REQUIREMENTS.md` is a living document, and **AD1–AD7 are now ACCEPTED with Q1–Q5
  resolved** — nothing blocks implementation. Don't re-litigate a settled decision; the
  rationale and the rejected alternatives are recorded there. If one genuinely needs
  reopening, change that file in the same commit as the code that acts on it.
- **The decisions that shape code**, so a fresh session doesn't re-derive them:

  | Decision | Consequence in code |
  | --- | --- |
  | Per-stage records, status derived (R3) | No `status` column. Status = newest stage row for an idea. |
  | Refurb at DEVELOP first, DESIGN later (R4) | `builds.refurb_of` + `refurb_entry` (`design`\|`develop`). |
  | Learnings deferred (R5) | Nothing appended to phase prompts. The Store layer stays unbuilt. |
  | Rank on human rating 1–5 only (R7/Q1) | Tier-0 is recorded and gates deploys, but never ranks. Unrated title → newest Tier-0-passing deploy is the candidate. |
  | Build owns the URL (Q4/AD5) | One here.now site per build; nothing overwrites. Slug lives in `deploys`, never in a file under `dev-output/`. here.now slugs are random — never write code that requests a hostname. |
  | Self-hosted FastAPI, **kept mountable** (Q5/AD3) | `api/` is real, but must run standalone *or* mounted into the LangGraph server via `langgraph.json`'s `http.app`. No work in `main`; DB session and startup as dependencies + lifespan. That keeps Q5 reversible. |
  | SQLite + SQLModel (AD1) | Same Pydantic idiom as the graph's structured outputs. Postgres = URL change + migration. |

- **Three things to carry forward, not forget:** keep the domain API mountable (above), stand
  up the owned-subdomain start page once the app runs, and revisit R5 once there is history.
- **The notebook is the spike environment. Port from it; do not fork it.** New phases get
  prototyped in a notebook and moved into the app — the notebook stays the place to
  experiment.
- Keep the expensive knowledge intact when porting. The develop phase's model config,
  streaming behaviour, retry middleware, chunked tool protocol and Tier-0 validation were
  all won the hard way (see *The develop phase* below).

## The reference implementation

`mabstruct_studio` is an experimental **multi-agent game studio** built on LangGraph: a
pipeline that turns a single game title into a playable single-file HTML5 browser game,
published to a live URL.

```
IDEATION --> DESIGN --> DEVELOP --> DEPLOY (here.now)
```

Everything currently lives in two Jupyter notebooks — there is no package, module, or
entrypoint. `mabstruct_studio` is a subdirectory of the larger `pingmab-agents` course repo
(the parent `.venv`, `pyproject.toml`, and `.env` are shared).

- **`mabstruct_studio.ipynb`** — the maintained notebook. Covers IDEATION → DESIGN →
  DEVELOP → DEPLOY for a single idea, no fan-out. The test phase was deliberately removed
  (commit `beb5eae8`).
- **`mabstruct_experimenting.ipynb`** — the spike/scratch notebook. Keeps the code that was
  pulled out of the studio notebook: `Send`-based parallel fan-out (`fan_out_develop` →
  `develop_one`), the Tier-1 test node, and `run_static_validation_full`. Look here first
  when re-adding a feature; port from here rather than rewriting. Both become relevant again
  once the app runs several ideas per title (R7).

## Running

**Python environment:** the parent repo's venv, `/Users/mab/dev/agents/pingmab-agents/.venv`
(Python 3.12.12, managed by `uv`). There is no venv inside `mabstruct_studio/`. Both
notebooks are already pinned to it — kernelspec `python3`, display name `.venv` — and it is
the only registered Jupyter kernel. If the kernel picker offers anything else (system
Python, a Cursor-created env), it is the wrong one and imports like `langchain_anthropic`
will fail.

```bash
cd /Users/mab/dev/agents/pingmab-agents   # parent repo owns the venv and pyproject.toml
uv sync                                    # install/refresh deps
.venv/bin/jupyter lab                      # or open the notebook in Cursor/VS Code
```

Run project code outside Jupyter with that same interpreter — `.venv/bin/python`, never bare
`python3` (only stdlib-only one-liners like the one below are safe with the system Python).
Add dependencies with `uv add <pkg>` from the parent repo, not `pip install`.

Read a notebook's code without launching Jupyter:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; nb=json.load(open('mabstruct_studio.ipynb')); print('\n'.join(''.join(c['source']) for c in nb['cells'] if c['cell_type']=='code'))"
```

Notebooks no longer depend on the kernel's cwd: `NOTEBOOK_DIR` is resolved from the notebook
file's own location (see *The develop phase* below), so `dev-output/` always lands next to
the notebook.

There is no test suite and no linter. The only automated checks are the in-notebook
validation tiers (below). `node` must be on PATH — Tier-0 shells out to `node --check`.

### API keys

`load_dotenv(override=True)` reads the parent repo's `.env`. Used: `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY` (web search), `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` +
`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (push notifications via the `send_push_notification` tool),
`HERE_NOW_API_KEY` (deploy — see below), and `LANGSMITH_*` for tracing (the cell after the
imports prints whether tracing is live).

## Architecture (as the notebook has it)

### State

One `GameStudioState` TypedDict flows through every graph:

```python
game_title: str
game_ideation: GameIdeaList | None
game_designs: Annotated[list[GameDesignRecord], operator.add]
game_developments: Annotated[list[GameDevelopRecord], operator.add]
game_deployments: Annotated[list[GameDeployRecord], operator.add]
game_html_path: str | None
deployment_url: str | None
```

List fields use `Annotated[..., operator.add]` so parallel workers can append without
clobbering. Records are joined by **`idea_id`** — a UUID assigned in `ideation_node` after
the LLM returns (the LLM never generates it). `GameIdea → GameDesignRecord →
GameDevelopRecord → GameDeployRecord` all carry it. There is no test/`game_tests` field; the
test phase lives only in the experimenting notebook.

### Per-phase models

Models are declared in one cell and swapped by reassigning a single variable
(`LLM_DEVELOP_MODEL = LLM_DEVELOP_OPUS_MODEL`). Keep that pattern — don't inline model IDs
in nodes. Several Opus-vs-Fable develop comparisons have been run; recording those results
is R7's job, and today they exist only in the operator's head.

The develop model is the delicate one, and the comments in that cell record hard-won
constraints:

- Use `ChatAnthropic(...)`, **not** the `"anthropic:claude-opus-5"` string form — the string
  defaults to `max_tokens=4096`, which truncates tool arguments mid-JSON.
- `streaming=True` is required at large `max_tokens` or the HTTP request times out.
- `ModelRetryMiddleware` retries transport faults (`DEVELOP_TRANSPORT_ERRORS`) because those
  surface while the SSE body streams — outside the SDK's own retry window.
- `AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware` is appended **only** when the model is a
  `ChatAnthropic`; on other providers it warns every turn and caches nothing.
- `gpt-5.6-sol` rejects any `reasoning_effort` other than `"none"` when tools are bound on
  chat completions.

### The develop phase (the interesting part)

The develop agent never writes HTML into chat. It calls `write_game_html_part(content,
part)` in a strict `start → js × N → end` sequence, built by `make_dev_tools(game_title,
idea_id)` — a closure so each parallel worker gets its own buffer. The tool aggressively
rejects malformed input (chunks over `MAX_JS_CHUNK_CHARS = 6000`, a `start` that closes
`</script>`, a `js` chunk containing HTML tags) and only writes to disk on `part=end`.

Output path is anchored to the **notebook's own directory**, not the kernel's cwd:
`_resolve_notebook_dir()` reads `__vsc_ipynb_file__` (VS Code/Cursor), then `__session__` /
`JPY_SESSION_NAME` (JupyterLab, Notebook 7), then falls back to walking up from cwd looking
for the notebook file. `STUDIO_OUTPUT_DIR = NOTEBOOK_DIR / "dev-output"`, giving
`mabstruct_studio/dev-output/<game_title>/<idea_id>/index.html` (the deploy node writes
`herenow.json` beside it; the experimenting notebook's test node writes `game_testing.json`
there too). The cell prints the resolved directory and how it was resolved, and warns loudly
if it had to fall back to cwd — that fallback is the one case where output could land
outside the `.gitignore` rule `mabstruct_studio/dev-output*/`. `develop_node` deletes any
stale `index.html` before the run so a leftover file can't be mistaken for this run's output.

**Validation tiers:**
- **Tier 0** (`run_static_validation`) — exactly one inline `<script>` block + `node --check`
  on it. Runs automatically on write and via the `verify_game_html` tool.
- **Tier 1** (`scripts/game_smoke_test.mjs`, deleted from the working tree but in git
  history; driven by the test node in the experimenting notebook) — executes the game JS in
  a hand-rolled DOM/canvas shim in `node:vm`, simulates a start click, and reports JSON.

On Tier-0 failure `develop_node` issues exactly **one** repair turn that continues the same
conversation — never a second full build. Failures are recorded in
`GameDevelopRecord.tier0_pass` + `summary` rather than raised.

### The deploy phase

`deployment_node` publishes the built `index.html` to [here.now](https://here.now) and
records a `GameDeployRecord` (`slug`, `site_url`, `deployed`, `summary`).

- **The Tier-0 gate is deterministic, not the agent's call.** `DEPLOY_REQUIRE_TIER0 = True`
  skips the deploy when the matching `GameDevelopRecord.tier0_pass` is false, and records a
  skipped deploy instead of raising.
- **Publishing is three steps** — create/update → upload → finalize. Nothing is live until
  finalize succeeds; it is idempotent by `versionId` and answers `409 finalize_in_flight` +
  `Retry-After` while another finalize holds the same version (wait and retry, not a
  failure). Re-publishing identical bytes deduplicates server-side, so the upload loop is
  driven off `uploads`, not the manifest.
- **here.now does not let a caller choose its slug**, so a stable URL means creating the site
  once and updating that slug forever after via `PUT /api/v1/publish/{slug}`; a 404 there
  means the recorded site is gone and a new one is created.
- **The API key has two spellings.** `_herenow_api_key()` accepts `HERE_NOW_API_KEY` (the
  parent repo's `.env`) and `HERENOW_API_KEY` (the here.now skill and the CrewAI tool), then
  falls back to `~/.herenow/credentials`. Without a key, every publish is an anonymous site
  that expires 24 hours later — the record carries a warning when that happens.
- **The registry file, not the agent's summary, is the source of truth** for what went live:
  an agent can describe a deploy it never made, but only `publish_game_site` writes
  `herenow.json`.

### Known rough edges

Both of these are reasons the application exists — fix them in the app, not by patching the
notebook into something it isn't.

**The pipeline is not one graph.** The composed `studio` graph is IDEATION → DESIGN only.
DEVELOP and DEPLOY each run in their own single-node graph (`dev_studio`, `deploy_studio`)
driven by hand-assembled state — the `dev_state = initial_state.copy()` cell sets
`game_ideation` to a bare `list[GameIdea]` and `game_designs` to a bare `GameDesignBrief`.
So `develop_node` reads `state["game_ideation"][0]` and `design.game_sub_title`, and
`deployment_node` reads `state["game_ideation"][CHOSEN_IDEA_INDEX]` — shapes that match that
hand-built state, not `GameIdeaList` / `GameDesignRecord`. Wiring all four phases into one
graph means reconciling those accessors.

**Idea selection is a constant.** `CHOSEN_IDEA_INDEX = 0`, hand-edited. R2 replaces it with
an `interrupt()` and a human choice that survives the session.

**Deployment identity lives in a copied file.** `dev-output/<title>/<idea_id>/herenow.json`
travels with the build folder, so copying a build copies its slug. All three builds under
`dev-output/The Big Swallow/` currently name the same slug `hazy-hazel-6pws` and have
overwritten each other; here.now version history needs a paid plan, so those overwrites are
not restorable. AD5 moves slug ownership into the domain DB — blocked on Q4 (what owns a
stable playtest URL: title, idea, or build label). The deploy-phase review session covering
this is parked; see `REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Conventions

- Prompts are module-level f-strings named `<PHASE>_SYSTEM_PROMPT` /
  `<PHASE>_HUMAN_PROMPT`, all sharing `MABSTRUCT_GAMESTUDIO_BACKGROUNDER` (sci-fi, cosmic,
  slightly surreal single-player browser games). Keep new phases on that naming.
- Agents are built with `create_agent(model=..., system_prompt=..., tools=...,
  response_format=SomePydanticModel)` and read back via `agent_result["structured_response"]`.
- Each phase gets a node function plus a small standalone `StateGraph` for testing it in
  isolation (`dev_builder` / `dev_studio`, `deploy_builder` / `deploy_studio`) before it
  joins the main graph.
- Every graph cell ends with `display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))`.
- `_message_text(message)` exists because Anthropic models return content as a list of
  blocks (thinking + text); never assume `message.content` is a string.
- Commit messages follow `type(mabstruct): summary`.

## Notes

- `.venv/` is at the parent repo root, not here.
- `memory.db` (SQLite checkpointer) is written next to the notebook and is disposable. So is
  everything under `dev-output/`. The domain DB that AD1 introduces will *not* be — it
  becomes the durable asset of this project.
- The "Persisting to SQLite" / "Adding a UI" / "Recap" cells at the end are leftover course
  scaffolding referencing a `graph`/`spanish` state that this notebook doesn't define — they
  are not part of the studio pipeline.
- Cell numbers drift as the notebook is edited; this file refers to cells by their content.
